          <p>ETH Belgrade Hackathon offers a three-day hacking experience with a primary focus on building on Ethereum. Following the success of the inaugural hackathon in 2023, we aim to surpass it in every aspect.</p>
          <p>This year, we&apos;re opening the doors for builders from all around the globe to join us both in-person and online (hybrid). Our goal is to gather hundreds of hackers and curious minds to develop projects and use cases that will reshape the Ethereum landscape and enhance people&apos;s lives.</p>
          <p>An attractive prize pool, numerous bounties, collaborations with people from top-tier protocols and an unparalleled opportunity to bring your fresh ideas to lifeâ€”these are just some of the benefits you&apos;ll gain by participating in the second edition of the ETH Belgrade conference.</p>
